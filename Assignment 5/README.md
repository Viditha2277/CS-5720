## Code Descriptions

Program 1: To implement Naïve Bayes method using scikit-learn library on glass.csv file
1. Reading the data.csv file using read_csv().
2. Entire data is spilt into training and testing data using train_test_splot() method imported from sklearn module.
3. Naïve Bayes model is imported from sklearn and loaded into “gnb” object. Then the training data and test data is used to tune the weights of the model.
4. Using predict() method, values are predicted for the test data.
5. Accuracy is calculated between the predicted and actual values using score().
6. Classification report is prepared that gives information on precision, recall, f1score, etc.

Program 2: To demonstrate Support vector machine method on the glass.csv file
1. Reading the data.csv file using read_csv() and showing basic statistical description of the data using describe().
2. Entire data is spilt into training and testing data using train_test_splot() method imported from sklearn module.
3. SVM model is imported from sklearn and loaded into “svm” object. Then the training data and test data is used to tune the weights of the model.
4. Using predict() method, values are predicted for the test data.
5. Accuracy is calculated between the predicted and actual values using score().
6. Classification report is prepared that gives information on precision, recall, f1score, etc.
