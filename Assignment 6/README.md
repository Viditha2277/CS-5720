## Code Descriptions

Program 1: To make predictions on the diabetes disease dataset using Neural Networks
1. Predictions are made on the diabetes dataset using deep neural network.
2. Predictions are made on the diabetes dataset by adding more dense layers to the previous network.
3. Diabetes dataset is replaced with the breast cancer dataset and training is done on the same model again with same parameters.
4. Breast cancer data is normalized, and the training is done with the same neural network again with the same parameters.

Program 2: To make predictions on MINST dataset using Image classification
1. Predictions are made on the MINST dataset loaded from keras.dataset module in TensorFlow and graphs for accuracy and loss are plotted.
2. Plotting one of the images in the test data, doing inferencing to check what is the prediction of the model on that single image.
3. Changing the number of hidden layers and the activation to tanh or sigmoid and training the network again on same data.
4. Running the same code without scaling the images and checking the performance.
